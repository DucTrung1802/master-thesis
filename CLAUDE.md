## 1. What this project is

A master's thesis on **predicting Vietnamese stock prices**. It is one repo carrying two
things: a **production data pipeline** (scrape → PostgreSQL medallion layers → feature
pools → model → scored run) and a **research record** of what that pipeline has been able
to prove, which is mostly negative and deliberately so.

| | |
|---|---|
| database | PostgreSQL `database_main_v2`, schemas `bronze_schema` / `silver_schema` / `gold_schema` / `unified_schema_<universe>`. Creds in repo `.env` (`POSTGRES_*`) |
| orchestrator | **Dagster, 80 assets** — `src/orchestration/` is THE entry point |
| universe | 781 VN tickers (HOSE/HNX/UPCOM); VCB is the single-name focus, VN30/VN100/LIQUID301/ALL/BANK the cross-sections |
| model | LSTM (2×128, ~276k params) and **CNN** (`Conv1d` over time) + the chain in §3b. `model/common/engine.py` is the shared engine — a model package is a `model.py` + a ~30-line binding, **never a copy of `train.py`** |
| interpreter | `mt_env` venv (`d:/GIT/master-thesis/mt_env`), Python 3.12.10, Windows, RTX 3050 4 GB |

## 2. ⚠️ THE VERDICT — read this before proposing any modelling work

**Single-stock short-horizon prediction does not work here, and this has been established
four independent times.** The one thing that survives its own null is the
**cross-sectional relative rank** at ~100+ names.

### 2a. What failed, and how it was measured

| thread | target | result | where |
|---|---|---|---|
| LSTM sweeps, 9 lookbacks × 3 targets (27 runs) | `return_5day`, `direction_5day`, `probability_gain_5pct_5day` | **no lookback beats the zero-baseline**; `dir_auc` ≈ 0.5 throughout | `model` §10 |
| feature selection, VCB, 5 configs | `return_5day` / `return_rel_5day` × 3 representations | **every one inside its own shuffled-label null** | `feature_selection` §6b–6d |
| news sentiment, 3 tickers | price level / direction / ≥5% jump / price-defined sentiment | no signal — and adding sentiment **makes price/TA models worse** (QWK 0.175 → 0.045) | `sentiment` §6, §6a |
| news EVENTS (not tone), 777 tickers | `rel5` / `rel10` / 1-13 weeks, paired by fold | **7 paired tests, every \|t\| < 1.3**, folds won 2-4 of 6, signs mixed. §6a reproduced at 259× the width | `orchestration/todo.md` (retired 2026-08-17) |
| literature, 23 papers | others' claims | **not one reports a naive baseline**; reported skill tracks test-set size (0.90@10d → 0.56@100d in one paper's own table); best honestly-run paper gets MCC 0.069 | `experiment_10` |

### ⚠️ 2a-bis. THE HORIZON IS THE VARIABLE NOBODY CONTROLLED FOR — and `h=5` is the worst of it

Measured 2026-08-03 on the weekly/daily news panels and **recovered 2026-08-17 from a
retired todo file, where it was the only copy.** The `controls` block — momentum
1/4/12/26 weeks plus liquidity, no text at all — is the one thing in that study that
worked, and whether it works **depends entirely on the horizon**:

| horizon | universe | `controls` CAGR | benchmark | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **rel5** (5 sessions) | top-100 | **−2.78%** | 9.75% | ❌ loses |
| **rel5** | top-30 | **2.68%** | 16.48% | ❌ loses |
| rel10 | top-100 | 9.86% | 9.98% | ❌ ties |
| rel10 | top-30 | 7.69% | 16.74% | ❌ loses |
| **4 weeks** | top-30 | **30.39%** | 18.07% | ✅ Sharpe 1.10 |
| **13 weeks** | top-30 | **28.63%** | 19.34% | ✅ Sharpe 1.06 |

**`controls` only beats its benchmark from 4 weeks out.** At 5-10 sessions it loses even
on the most liquid names — so at `h=5` it is not only news that dies, **momentum dies
too**. MCC on the full universe was +0.052…+0.061, positive in **30 of 30 folds**, and it
cost nothing: no corpus, no labelling, no fine-tune.

⚠️ **This bears directly on §2's verdict and on everything run at `d=20, h=5`.** Four
independent threads failed at a 5-day horizon; this is the one measurement that asked
whether the HORIZON was the problem rather than the features, and its answer is that VN
gives signal at 4-13 weeks and not at 5-10 sessions. Two independent sources predicted
it — the `project-vcb-forecasting-conclusion` memory, and paper 57 (daily news predicts
1-2 days then stops at t = 1.2; weekly news predicts 13 weeks). **Nothing in this repo
has yet been run end to end at a 4-week horizon.**

### 2b. What survived — the width ladder

Same pipeline, same target, same `d=20, h=5`, only the number of names changes. **The
observed IC barely moves; the noise floor collapses.**

| universe | N | daily-IC sd | observed IC | null p95 bar | z | clears |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| VCB | 1 | ~1.0 | +0.0559 | +0.0556 | +1.56 | ❌ |
| BANK (GICS 401010) | 20 | 0.244 | +0.0087 | +0.0249 | +0.11 | ❌ |
| **BANK re-measured 2026-08-10** | **20** | **0.230–0.280** | **−0.0106** | **+0.0216** | **−1.71** | ❌ **below its null's MEAN** |
| VN30 | 30 | 0.205 | +0.0233 | +0.0248 | +1.42 | ❌ |
| **VN100** | **100** | 0.130 | +0.0289 | +0.0117 | **+6.09** | ✅ |
| **LIQUID301** | **301** | — | +0.0768 | +0.0245 | **+18.45** | ✅ |
| ALL | 780 | — | +0.109 | *never ran* | — | ⚠️ unverified |

Three things this ladder means:

1. **The practical threshold is ~100 names, not ~30.** VN30 fails at `z = +1.42`,
   indistinguishable from one stock. A 20-name sector is worse.
2. **The mechanism is `1/√N` precision, not more observations.** `n_eff` is `n_dates/h`,
   **not** `n_rows/h` — 100 stocks on one Tuesday are one observation of the market. The
   cross-section buys precision per observation and nothing else.
3. **The rank target is the whole result.** Swapping `cs_rank_5day` for raw `return_5day`
   on the same panel and folds drops the IC 4× and pushes the hit rate below a coin.

### 2c. ⚠️ And the honest caveats on the survivor

- **The holdout does NOT confirm it.** +0.011 against a shuffled control of +0.0071, with
  SE ≈ 0.013. The uncontaminated estimate of what this earns out of sample is **+0.011**,
  not +0.029. (`feature_selection` §9g)
- **The universe is 100% survivors** — `silver.stocks_basic` holds no delisted name. This
  biases the overall result *toward* zero, **except** through `close_adjust`, where the
  truncation itself manufactures the "cheap stocks outperform" pattern.
- **It has never been traded profitably.** Costed walk-forward: AUC ceiling ≈ 0.52–0.53,
  65–78%/leg weekly turnover, net@20bps **+1.46 Sharpe (2017-20) vs −0.51 (2022-26)**, dead
  at 40bps. (`model` §11, `experiment` exp_3)
- **The current end-to-end chain shows no skill on either universe** — see §6.

### 2d. The one lever left

**New information, not more modelling.** Ranked: active/aggressor buy-sell imbalance
(needs intraday tick), fundamentals/earnings surprise, news+disclosure event dates,
**point-in-time index membership** (kills the survivorship bias above), order-book L2.
`model` §11 has the full ranked list with why each matters.

```

⚠️ **FOUR DATE-BROADCAST POOLS ARE NEW (2026-08-13)**, built for **VCB** so far and
generated from ONE spec table (`DATE_SPINE_POOLS`). All four are the `pool__economy`
shape — a `date`-only gold source LEFT JOINed and BROADCAST across tickers, so the row
count must EQUAL the spine's — not the `pool__ta` one. Each: PK verified from
`pg_index`, **0 round-trip mismatches** against gold, 0 unaligned keys.

| pool | source | VCB | col coverage | source ends |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `pool__forex` | `gold.forex`, 357 broker pairs | 4,266 × 360 | median **67.0%** | 29 of 357 in Aug, **328 at 2026-06-08/09** |
| `pool__funds` | `gold.funds`, 21 HOSE ETFs × ≤19 measures | 4,266 × 392 | median **17.7%** | 2 of 21 in Aug, **19 at 2026-06-26** |
| `pool__bonds` | `gold.bonds`, 9 tenors × 13 measures | 4,266 × 120 | median **75.9%** | **all 9 at 2026-06-08** |
| `pool__stock_market` | `gold.stock_market`, 6 indices × 27 measures | 4,266 × 165 | median **83.1%** | 2026-07-30 (CafeF chain) |

⚠️ **THE THREE TRADINGVIEW SOURCES ARE FROZEN AND `MAX(date)` HIDES IT** — the
`skip_existing=True` scrape of 2026-08-05, which queued **0 bond data tasks at all**.
`stock_market` is a CafeF chain and 6 days short for a different reason.

⚠️ **`pool__stock_market` CONTAINS THE TARGET'S OWN BENCHMARK.**
`hose__vnindex__close_adjust` is `UNIFIED_BENCHMARK_COLUMN`, the series `pool__targets`
subtracts for `return_rel_{h}day`. The pool carries **`bm[t]` and trailing history,
never `bm[t+h]`** — verified, 0 rows hold a future value — so there is **no leakage**;
what is true is that the target's own denominator is now a feature. Its order-flow and
foreign-flow measures are the closest anything in this database gets to §2d's top lever.
⚠️ `pool__funds` is **31.7% NULL by construction** and its widest column IS the VN30
index. ⚠️ On `pool__bonds` **the slope is the signal and it is not a column**:
`vn10y − vn02y` must be derived. `orchestration/CONTEXT.md` §"`pool__forex`" /
§"`pool__funds`" / §"`pool__bonds`" / §"`pool__stock_market`".

⚠️ **`unified/pool__basic_bank` (2026-08-14) is the fifth, and the only one with NO
TABLE BEHIND IT.** `silver.stocks_basic` filtered to GICS 401010 and **pivoted on the
fly** to `{exchange}__{ticker}__{measure}` — 20 banks × 27 measures = **540 channels**,
VCB 4,266 × 543, 0 mismatches against silver. ⚠️ **It found that `pool__basic` was 12
columns behind its own source**: silver has 38, the pool on disk had 26, the missing
twelve all flow (`foreign_*` ×8, `prop_*` ×4) — ✅ **fixed 2026-08-16, all three
partitions rebuilt.** ⚠️ **The schema's own ticker is one
of the channels** — `hose__vcb__*` IS `pool__basic`'s own columns (asserted, 0 mismatches
on 15 mirrored measures), so joining both holds each VCB measure twice. ⚠️ Membership is
derived from current GICS and is **not point-in-time** — survivors only.
**`pool__basic_vn30` was deferred** for the same reason in its worst form (`vn30.csv` is
today's list with no history), and **`pool__financials` was not built — it is
`pool__fa`.**

### ⚠️ `pool__basic` CARRIES DERIVED FEATURES NOW (2026-08-16) — it is not a copy

It was `SELECT *` over `silver.stocks_basic` for its whole life. It is now that **plus
58 trailing `drv_*` channels** computed in SQL in the same CTAS — **63 on a universe
partition**, where 5 cross-sectional ones are added. VCB **4,266 × 96**, BANK
**54,528 × 101**, ALL **2,388,975 × 101** (11m8s). The surviving contract is the SUBSET
one and it is still asserted: every silver column, silver's type, silver's value. The
derived set is asserted as an **equality**, so a leaked CTE helper raises.

Seven blocks, chosen against `gold.stocks_ta`'s 935 columns to avoid duplicating it:
**bar shape** (7 — incl. `gap_open_pct`, the only overnight information a daily bar
has), **range volatility** (9 — Parkinson / Garman-Klass / Rogers-Satchell, none of
which existed anywhere), **normalisation** (13 — `close_z_*`, `close_pos_*`,
`dist_from_high_*`, skew/kurt), **order flow** (10 — §2d's top lever at daily grain;
`pool__ta` has 0 hits for "order" or "imbalance"), **foreign/prop** (8), **liquidity**
(7 — Amihud, VWAP), **cross-sectional** (5, universe only — per §2b the one block
anything has ever survived a null in).

⚠️ **Five traps, all measured** (`orchestration/CONTEXT.md`): silver's `open/high/low`
are **RAW** and track `close_raw` (4,266/4,266 vs 248 on VCB), so the bar is
split-adjusted first; **`value_matched` is BILLIONS of VND** while `foreign_*_value` /
`prop_*_val` are plain VND (the first draft reported a participation ratio of
215,150,099); **bigint/bigint is integer division** (a channel returned a flat 0);
`STDDEV_SAMP` over bigint returns `numeric` → the rule-15 `Decimal`→`object` trap; and
**PostgreSQL computes PARTIAL frames by default**, so a 252-day channel was a 10-day
channel for every series' first year — 188,737 rows of `ALL`. ⚠️ **pandas could not see
that last one**: `rolling(w)` defaults to `min_periods=w`, so the cross-check compared
only where both were defined.

✅ **Verified**: 20 channels against an independent pandas recomputation (16 at ≤9.5e-13;
skew/kurt are the **population** estimators, matching `scipy…(bias=True)` at 2e-15 and
differing from pandas' sample-corrected form by design), **0 name collisions** with
`pool__ta`/`pool__fa`, **0 history bleed** across all 781 `ALL` series, and a causality
test — the whole block rebuilt on data truncated at 2026-06-15 reproduces all 58 columns
on 4,227 shared rows at **max abs diff exactly 0.0**.

⚠️ **`OUT-1`: one corrupt source cell manufactured a finding — FIXED 2026-08-16 in
silver.** `silver.stocks_basic` VCB **2026-01-05** carried `prop_buy_val = 4.001e17`
against that day's whole turnover of 2.06e11 — an implied 5.7e11 VND/share. That single
cell drove `corr(drv_prop_net_value_ratio, drv_prop_participation)` to **exactly +1.0**
and manufactured a **+0.266** correlation against the forward 5-day return.

`_helper_screen_flow_outliers` NULLs a flow value/volume pair (never winsorises — the
corruption factor is not constant, so there is nothing to divide out) on **three** rules,
and it took three because each of the first two has a blind spot: **implied price** off
`close_raw` by >100× (99.5% of flow rows sit within **2×**, 99.98% within 100×);
**flow volume** >100× the day's total, for rows where value *and* volume are corrupt
together so the price looks fine (`STB` carries 1.5e13 shares); and **flow value** >100×
turnover, the only rule that works when the volume is NULL — `SHB 2025-10-30` slipped
past the first two that way. **611 of 2,388,975 rows (0.0256%)**, row count unchanged.
On VCB the two symptoms go **+1.000000 → +0.3270** and **+0.2658 → +0.0280**.

⚠️ **A second defect, in the derived block itself, found in the same pass**: the flow
ratios divided by MATCHED turnover, but flow trades in the negotiated channel too
(`ABB 2026-06-26`: 19 bn matched against **393 bn negotiated**). The denominator is now
matched + negotiated, taking `drv_foreign_net_value_ratio` from **[−239.6, +75.0]** to
**[−4.87, +2.27]**. ⚠️ **Two classes remain unscreened and reported**: 2,844 pairs with
a real volume and a ZERO value (mixed — 305 of 857 `prop_sell` imply ≥1 BN VND, so *not*
just rounding), and 196 rows with flow on a no-trade day.

⚠️ **NEW ISSUE `STA-1`: `gold.stocks_ta` was not built by the current builder.** It
carries **13 legacy column names** (`val_matched_bn`, `f_net_val`, `vol_matched`, …) and
**zero** of silver's, holds **2,678,167 rows against silver's 2,388,975**, and stops at
2026-06-26. Nothing in the repo produces those names. So rebuilding it is not
maintenance — it renames 13 columns and moves 289 k rows, and `pool__ta` inherits all of
it. That is why the 1e9 fix below shipped as code **without** the rebuild.

⚠️ **The same 1e9 unit bug was found in `gold.stocks_ta.foreign_net_val_ratio`** —
`ta_functions.py:2773` and `sentiment_features.py:142` divided VND by billions of VND.
median(stored ÷ honest) = **999,999,998.1** over 769,188 rows; 46% of 1.67 M rows hold a
"ratio" above 10. **Both fixed.** It changed no result and that is worth stating: an
exact constant multiplier is rank-preserving (`Spearman = 1.0000000000`), every ranker
here is rank-based, and `StandardScaler` removes a constant scale — wrong **units**, not
wrong **ordering**. The table on disk still holds the old values (STA-1).

### ✅ FOREX: 357 → 3,129 series, ingested end to end (2026-08-14)

`bronze 13,662,058 rows / 3,129 series / 48 exchanges / 2000-01-02 → 2026-08-14` →
`silver.forex` (same) → **`gold.forex_<exchange>`, 48 panels summing to 3,129** →
**`unified_schema_vcb.pool__forex_<exchange>`, 48 pools × 4,266 spine rows**.
Round-tripped at every hop, 0 mismatches; the pre-split `gold.forex` and `pool__forex`
are dropped, on success only.

⚠️ **`gold.forex` IS MANY TABLES NOW (`WID-1`, resolved same day).** 3,129 series is
3,130 columns against PostgreSQL's 1,600, so it took the split `gold.economy` makes per
country — widest panel `forex_fx_idc` at **648 columns**. `gold/forex` left the
`WIDE_PANELS` spec table (that builder asserts one row count, one column count, one date
range — true of a table, false of a family) and `pool__forex` followed to
`pool__forex_<exchange>`. **Anything naming `gold.forex` or `pool__forex` is naming a
dropped table.** ⚠️ Unlike economy these panels do **not** share a calendar and it is not
asserted: brokers quote what they quote (B2PRIME starts 2015, SAXO 2000).

⚠️ **AND CLEARING IT EXPOSED `SHP-1`: 71% OF THE FOREX FOLDER HAD BEEN SILENTLY
DISCARDED ON EVERY PREVIOUS RUN.** The scraper writes two file shapes — OHLCV or
`value`, **4,402 files against 1,787** — and every clean layer filters on `value`, so the
old all-files `pd.concat` produced a `value` column from the *other* files and dropped
every OHLC row without a word. That is the whole reason bronze held 357 series. `value`
is now coalesced from `close`, justified by the extraction JS rather than by overlap
(no series carries both shapes): it pushes `v[4]` as `close` in one branch and `v[4]` as
`value` in the other — **the same slot of the same array**. ⚠️ **`bonds`, `funds`,
`economy` and `indices` have the same filter and have never been counted.**

⚠️ **The bronze forex ingest reads in BATCHES of 300 files** (6,189 files / 2.19 GB /
29.6 M rows would need 10-15 GB against 3.6 GB free). That also inverts which duplicate
wins: the old `keep="first"` in glob order let the **stale** file win, batched upserts in
name order let the **newest** win.

### ⚠️ How the forex got there — the scrape (2026-08-14)

Re-scraped in two runs, both green, 0 ERROR lines: **links 47 of 47 brokers (1h09m)**,
**data 10 brokers (2h15m, 668 fetched + 229 skipped)**. Verified symbol-by-symbol
afterwards rather than from the green run — **897 of 897, 0 missing, 0 empty**, each
folder single-exchange, fresh to 2026-08-13.

**`parameters.data_only` is new and is the one place links and data may disagree** —
links enumerate everything, the fetch is restricted to a subset. Data may never enable
what links does not (the adder reads the links CSV its own leaf wrote); `validate()`
raises on that, on an empty list and on an unknown class.

| | |
|---|---|
| brokers enumerated | 47 of 47 — **27 clean, 19 contaminated, 1 empty** |
| symbols fetched | 897 of 1,722 addressable = **52%** (10 of 27 clean brokers) |
| series on disk | 6,189 files / 2.19 GB → **3,129 series, 48 exchanges** (all ingested) |

⚠️ **`FLT-1` — the forex broker filter fails OPEN for 19 of 47 brokers**, returning a
49-exchange `FX_IDC` default list; six returned byte-identical ~16,700-symbol lists.
**37 of 47 brokers' own books are unreachable until it is fixed**, and the folder name in
`data/forex/` tells you nothing — the filename does. The 2,177 series that came from
those mixed folders are real data under wrong folder names, and they ingested fine:
bronze splits `symbol` on `:`, so the exchange is always correct.

⚠️ **Never sum rows across a leaf's links CSVs.** A broker folder accumulates one dated
CSV per run (5 now) and the data adder reads only the NEWEST. Summing reads as growth
that is not there — saxo "269 → 438" where the newest snapshot holds 169 and the union
of all five also holds 169.

⚠️ **One asset writes no database table.** `analysis/feature_selection_economy`
(2026-08-10) runs the selection over `pool__basic + pool__economy_<country>` and
archives a run folder; `feature_selection` is read-only by design. It defaults to a
**20-draw null** (the 18 hand-launched country runs all used 0) and **raises** both when
the country pool is behind `pool__basic`'s calendar and when its fitted cost estimate
exceeds `budget_minutes` — `usa` is 1,458 channels, 7.2 h with no null and **6.3 days**
at 20 draws. `feature_selection/CONTEXT.md` §15.

`python -m pipeline` prints which stage is stale and runs the stale ones. **It passes no
data between stages** — each already reads the previous one's output; the module only
*checks* that what the next stage will read exists and agrees.

⚠️ **The `data` stage's status is a DATE, never a green asset** (§5 rule 10). It compares
`MAX(date)` in `pool__basic` against the newest date in the raw CafeF CSV, and on its
first run that caught a real 31-session gap. `--rescrape` is opt-in and is scoped to
`--ticker` with `skip_existing=False` — without both, a "re-scrape" either costs 781
tickers or fetches nothing.

⚠️ **`--root` + `--scope` run a NARROWER experiment without dropping the wider table.**
`final_features` groups on `(schema, target, setup)`, a key with **no term for which
pools** — so a `pool__basic`-only run archived into the default root silently widens
`return_5day__final__d20_h5` and triggers the STL-1 domino. `--root` keeps the run out of
that group; `--scope basic` names its table `…__d20_h5__basic`. Both are needed.
`src/pipeline/CONTEXT.md` §5c.

⚠️ **`d` and `h` come from the source TABLE NAME**, never a parameter. They flow
`return_5day__final__d20_h5` → dataset `metadata.json` → asserted against the model config.

⚠️ **THE NOTEBOOK AND `feature_selection.run` PRODUCE THE SAME ARTEFACT SINCE
2026-08-16 — AND DID NOT BEFORE.** `RUN__feature_importance_report.ipynb` recorded no
`input.columns_by_table` (so the next stage GUESSED each channel's pool, which returns
`unknown` for every pool built since 2026-08-10 and silently names `pool__ta` for a forex
channel), no `execution` block, and **no `outstanding.csv` at all** — and a run folder
without one is skipped by `final_features.plan_from_reports` **without a word**. Measured
2026-08-15: the two newest runs, both produced through `kaggle_gpu`, were in exactly that
state while `final_features` planned 19 runs and reported no error. The notebook now
writes and validates the shortlist (`contract.validate_shortlist`) and prints
`contract.describe()` — the handoff as the next stage will see it.
`feature_selection/CONTEXT.md` §18.

⚠️ **EVERY ENTRY POINT PRINTS ITS GPU AND ITS RUNTIME NOW** (`utils/runtime.py`, one
clock and one GPU probe, GMT+7). `pipeline` and `kgpu` were the two that were left and
they are the two that run longest. **`pipeline` needed a SECOND clock, per stage**: it
calls the stages IN-PROCESS, so each module's own banner lives in its `main()` and never
fires — a `--apply` run printed no per-stage timing at all. Its `runtime` column is
**empty, never `0`**, for a skipped or planned stage. **`kgpu` prints no GPU on purpose**:
the card that matters is a Kaggle T4, and its clock is the ROUND TRIP, not the selection.
`feature_selection/CONTEXT.md` §18a.

### 3c. ⚠️ TWO selection layers, and the pool between them (2026-08-13, REBUILT 2026-08-16)

⚠️ **THE CODE BELOW WAS DOCUMENTED HERE FOR THREE DAYS WITHOUT EXISTING.** It was
written and RUN on 2026-08-13 — `pool__shortlist__close_adjust_5day__d20_h5` (4,266 ×
892) sat in the database with its source runs named in its own `COMMENT` — and **never
committed**: `git log --all -S"Pre-final shortlist"` finds no commit, `final_features`
on disk had no `--shape` flag, and the `final_features/CONTEXT.md §8` this section
cites did not exist. Rewritten 2026-08-16 from that table's `COMMENT` and this section.
**A documented feature is not a shipped one, and the check that catches it is `grep`.**

**The layer-1 union is not a consensus.** 725 of 750 channels in the old VCB table were
chosen by exactly one run — arithmetic, not agreement: each run saw `pool__basic + one`
macro block, so a macro channel *could not* be a candidate twice. `final_features`
§6 called the fix "ONE selection run over the joined pool"; the pre-final pool is the
cheap version — the one run over the 889 **survivors** instead of ~3,000 candidates.

- **`pool__shortlist__<target>__d<d>_h<h>`** — `--shape shortlist`. Keys + channels,
  **no label column** (`pool__targets` is joined by whoever reads it, as for any pool).
  The `pool__` prefix is load-bearing: `--pools`, `UnifiedSchemaReader.pools()`, the
  pipeline calendar check and the run-folder scope all key on it, so it needed no new code.
- **The target is IN the name** because this pool, unlike every raw one, is
  **target-conditioned** — its channels were kept *using* that label at that window.
  Selecting over it for another target is leakage.
- ⚠️ **Never name a shape with a `__final__` SEGMENT.** `FINAL_TABLE`'s target group
  permits underscores, so `…__pre__final__d20_h5` parses, yielding `target='…__pre'` — a
  column that exists nowhere, found stages later. `__prefinal__` was rejected for this.
- **A run is layer 2 iff its `outstanding.csv` says `source_table=pool__shortlist__*`** —
  a fact about the run, not a flag. `final_features --shape final` then builds from
  layer 2 **whenever any exists**, else unions everything as before. The switch shows up
  in the printed plan, in the table `COMMENT` (`Selection layer N:`) and in the
  fingerprint, so a stale table reports STALE rather than being accepted.
- ⚠️ **`--apply` stops at `shortlist_pool`**: the layer-2 run must exist before
  `final_features` can use it, and that run is manual. `selection_2` reports
  `MANUAL — cannot be produced here`. `final_features/CONTEXT.md` §8.

**First build, 2026-08-13**: `pool__shortlist__close_adjust_5day__d20_h5`, **4,266 × 892**
(889 channels + 3 keys), all 20 source pools on one calendar so the INNER join loses 0
rows, `evidence=no_null=20`.

**And the first layer-2 run through it, same day — 58.5 min on the GPU, `--null-draws 0`:**

| | layer 1 (20 runs, unioned) | layer 2 (1 run, competing) |
|---|---|---|
| shortlisted | **889** | **59** |
| `ic_mean` selected | +0.2505 … −0.2618 per run | **+0.0324** |
| `ic_trend_per_fold` | negative in 15 of 20 | **−0.1594** |
| evidence | `no_null=20` | `no_null` |

⚠️ **The mechanism works — 889 collapse to 59 once they compete — and the result is still
nothing.** The +0.0324 is two folds out of five (**+0.489, +0.527, −0.677, −0.265,
+0.088**), `close_adjust` ranks 1st again (the price level "predicting" the price level at
ρ 0.996), `hit_rate` is 1.000 and R² −8.11 because the target is a price LEVEL, and no
null was paid for. The 59 spread over 17 countries with 2 price channels — what a
selection returns when there is nothing to find. **Fixing the union did not fix the
target**; the next run worth doing is this one on `return_5day`. `final_features/CONTEXT.md`
§8f.

⚠️ **The cost model in `feature_selection/CONTEXT.md` §15c was re-fitted on this run**
(§15c-refit): across 21 GPU runs, `minutes ≈ 0.364 × channels^0.77`, R² 0.87 — **not**
the CPU-era `k = 2.00`, which under-predicts narrow runs ~5× and over-predicts wide ones
~35%. A wide run with no null is ~1 h, not 3.

### 3d. ⚠️ THE SELECTION CAN RUN ON A KAGGLE T4 NOW — `src/kaggle_gpu/` (2026-08-15)

`kgpu` runs **an unmodified repo notebook** on Kaggle's free GPUs (30 GPU-h/week,
2×T4 **15 GiB** against this machine's 4 GiB) and merges the run folder back into
`reports/feature_selection/`, where `outstanding`, `final_features` and `pipeline`
already look for it. `RUN__feature_importance_report.ipynb` is not edited — the
copy in `.build/` is.

```powershell
cd src\kaggle_gpu
python -m kgpu plan     feature-selection   # what would run; touches nothing
python -m kgpu data     feature-selection   # DB -> parquet -> private dataset
python -m kgpu rehearse feature-selection   # the WORKER side, locally, no quota
python -m kgpu run      feature-selection   # push, wait, download, merge
```

⚠️ **The worker cannot reach `database_main_v2`**, so the pools travel as parquet
in a private dataset and `UnifiedSchemaReader` is swapped for a **subclass** whose
`read`/`column_types`/`tables`/`overview` come from that payload. **`join()` is
inherited, not re-implemented** — the one-to-one validation and the `join_log` in
the report are the same code that runs here.

⚠️ **Parameters are rewritten IN PLACE in the notebook's own parameter cell, never
appended after it.** That cell ends with `EXCLUDE = IDENTITY + [c for c in
ALL_TARGETS if c != TARGET]`; an override cell placed after it leaves `EXCLUDE`
excluding the OLD target, which hands the run's own label to `FeatureSelector` as
a candidate feature. It does not raise — it reports an IC near 1.

⚠️ **Two things measured on the first real round trip (2026-08-15), both of which
had passed every local check:** Kaggle **unpacks `source.zip` into `source/` and
deletes the archive**, so the uploaded payload and the mounted payload are
different shapes; and `dataset_status` returns **`ready` immediately** on a new
version of an existing dataset, so a kernel pushed on that answer mounts the
PREVIOUS version and completes normally on stale data. `wait_ready` now requires
the version NUMBER to move. `rehearse` runs both payload shapes.

⚠️ **A T4 run does not reproduce an RTX 3050 run, and the LIBRARY STACK differs
too.** XGBoost subsamples from a different RNG stream per device
(`feature_selection/CONTEXT.md` §16), and Kaggle's image is **xgboost 3.2.0 /
sklearn 1.6.1 / numpy 2.0.2** against `mt_env`'s **2.1.1 / 1.7.2 / 2.2.6**
(measured 2026-08-15 from the two `environment` blocks) — a major version of the
ranker itself. A Kaggle run is a different **procedure**, not the same one on
faster hardware. The commit is pinned into the report from the export, because the
worker has no repo and `report._git_commit()` would otherwise write `null`.

**First run through it, 2026-08-15** — `pool__basic + pool__targets`, `return_5day`,
`d=20 h=5`, `device=cuda`, **20 null draws, 3.7 min end to end** (the same pool with
no null was ~390 s locally). 7 of 15 channels kept; `ic_mean` **+0.0494** against a
p95 bar of **+0.0510** — **does not clear**, z = +1.60, p = 0.1429, null max
**+0.0714** (above the observed, so rule 3 applies). §2 stands: the affordable null
is now the point, not the result.

```

⚠️ **`usa` raises at the default budget and is meant to.** ~1,458 channels is ~3.1 h
with no null and ~2.7 days at 20 draws; override `budget_minutes` for that ONE
partition rather than lowering the default. `feature_selection/CONTEXT.md` §15c.

⚠️ **THE COST MODEL HAS NO TERM FOR THE TARGET AND IT IS WORTH 13.7×** (2026-08-14).
`minutes ≈ 0.364 × channels^0.77` was fitted on 21 runs, **20 of them on the price
LEVEL `close_adjust_5day`**. The same 357-channel `pool__forex` panel took **2,016 s**
on that target and **146 s** on `return_5day`, because `lasso` — the dominant cost —
zeroes every coefficient on a return and converges at once. **A 20-draw null on a wide
pool is affordable for a return target** (357 channels + 20 draws = 41 min, measured),
where the fitted model implies ~12 h. `evidence=no_null` on a return run is now a
choice, not a budget. `feature_selection/CONTEXT.md` §15c-target.

⚠️ **AND THE 13.7× WAS `lasso`, WHICH IS OUT OF THE DEFAULT ENSEMBLE SINCE 2026-08-16.**
The six rankers were chosen in 2026-08-03 for what each one SEES and **had never been
measured against each other**. They now have been (`feature_selection/CONTEXT.md` §19 —
two targets × two widths, each method's own top-k scored out of sample against a 40-draw
random-k control), and **`METHODS` is now `spearman, xgb_shap, permutation`**:

| dropped from the default | measured |
|---|---|
| **`lasso`** | **87.2 % of the average archived run's wall clock** (90-96 % of every country run) — and on BOTH measured targets it zeroed every coefficient, so its column is a CONSTANT and the ensemble was bit-identical without it. Removed on cost and inertness; its standalone score is withdrawn, not low (§19b) |
| **`mutual_info`** | the **worst standalone ranker measured** (42.5th percentile, min 7.5th — below chance), and the dearest once lasso is gone (46 % of ranking time) |
| **`xgb_gain`** | ρ = **0.864** with `xgb_shap` **from the same fit** — one model held 2 of 6 votes; second worst standalone (46.2nd percentile, also below chance) |

⚠️ **`permutation` is load-bearing and the only member that is:** every other
leave-one-out subset scored at or ABOVE the full six (80.0); dropping this one put the
blend at **56.2** against chance's 50, in all four cells. ⚠️ **Nothing was deleted** —
`ALL_METHODS` still holds all six and `methods=ALL_METHODS` reproduces an older run; all
19 archived shortlists were verified to rebuild identically. ⚠️ **An mRMR member was
tested and REJECTED** — 100th percentile on one target, 50th on the other (§19f).

✅ **`MTH-1` RESOLVED the same day.** `methods` was recorded in `metadata.json` but not
in `contract.SETUP_KEYS`, so a pre- and a post-2026-08-16 run could be unioned into one
table with nothing saying so. It is in `SETUP_KEYS` now, and **the archive did not have
to be invalidated to get there** — which is what had blocked the fix, since an absent
SETUP_KEY raises. `contract.LEGACY_SETUP_DEFAULTS` gives a run that recorded no ensemble
the reading **`"unrecorded"`**, so the 19 archived runs still validate and still plan
while grouping apart from both the three-ranker default and a deliberate
`methods=ALL_METHODS` reproduction. ⚠️ **`"unrecorded"` is deliberately not read as "the
six"** even though those runs used six — §5 rule 2, an absent measurement is absent, not
inferred. ⚠️ **Grouping is order-insensitive** (`contract.canonical_methods` sorts): the
ensemble is a MEAN over its members, so order cannot change the answer and must not
split a table. ⚠️ **Expect this on the next run** — a new three-ranker `vcb__basic` run
and the 19 archived runs are two groups that still want ONE table name, so
`plan_from_reports` **raises on the collision rather than unioning**. Pass
`--scope basic`. Pinned by `feature_selection/tests/test_contract.py` (19 tests).

⚠️ **THE SELECTION RUNS ON THE GPU NOW, AND `device` IS PART OF THE SETUP** (2026-08-10).
Every one of the 22 archived runs recorded `device="cpu"` — the GPU had never been used —
and simply forcing `cuda` made a run **6.8× SLOWER**, because sklearn's
`permutation_importance` copied a whole DataFrame per draw and the feature↔target
Spearman built a 584 MB p×p matrix to keep one column. Both were rewritten and `lasso`
was reimplemented (FISTA, same objective, same purged folds, identical selected alpha);
the same run is now **1,046 s → 66.9 s** and the default is `device="auto"`. ⚠️ **A GPU
re-run does NOT reproduce an archived one** — XGBoost subsamples from a different RNG
stream per device, so the kept set moves (58 of 62 in common). `feature_selection/CONTEXT.md`
§16, and §16d for the one step that was converted, verified exact, measured 4-8× SLOWER
and deliberately left on the host.

⚠️ **NEVER `Materialize all` / `*` / a bare backfill.** With every partition live that
takes `raw/cafef_pdfs` (100 tickers × ~1-1.7 GB), `raw/trading_view@stocks` (777 tickers,
~10 h) and `raw/cafef_financials` (~2.4 h/ticker). Materialise a group or a named asset.

---

## 5. ⚠️ Standing rules — the cross-cutting ones, learned expensively

**Evidence**

1. **Every selection needs its own null, re-run whenever the pool or representation
   changes.** `zscore` moved its own bar 43% with no change to the data. A bar computed
   for one configuration says nothing about another.
2. **An absent null is recorded as absent, never implied to be a pass.** `"null": null`
   means no bar was computed. `evidence=no_null` is an *unknown*; `failed_null` is a
   *measurement*.
3. **`clears_bar` is the wrong summary whenever the null MAX exceeds the observed** —
   quote the max beside it. `pool__ta` cleared its p95 and one of 20 shuffled draws still
   beat the real data.
4. **Every single-score holdout needs a shuffled-label control.** With one score there is
   no fold spread, so the control IS the error bar — and it has reached +0.169 against
   real results of at most +0.071.
5. **Report the IC trend beside the mean.** A mean built from folds decaying to negative
   is not a signal.

**Leakage & sample size**

6. **THE PURGE GAP IS `d + h − 1`, NOT `h`.** At `d=20, h=5` that is 24 rows. Purging only
   `h` leaves 19 rows of the test sample's own input window in training — the easiest way
   to make a windowed model look predictive. `feature_selection.PurgedWalkForward.gap`
   computes it and `train_test_creator` applies the same one at each split boundary.
7. **`n_eff` is `n/h` for a series and `n_dates/h` for a PANEL.** 635 test samples ≈ 127
   independent observations; 13,028 panel rows over 653 dates ≈ 130.6, not 2,606. Both
   figures are still optimistic — they price in label overlap, not input overlap.
8. **Imputation is the TRAIN-slice median, never `ffill().bfill()`.** `bfill` fills a
   leading gap with the first *future* observation. And the "train slice" is the rows
   carried by a train SAMPLE — the cut *minus* the purge gap, not `date < val_start`.
9. **Never standardise a 0/1 label.** A classification dataset must be built with
   `scale_target=False`; `_verify` raises otherwise.

**The pipeline lies in specific ways**

10. **A green asset is NOT evidence of fresh data.** `landed()` answers "is this folder
    empty?", not "did THIS run produce anything". `skip_existing=True` means a scrape can
    go green in 500 ms having fetched nothing — or worse, having fetched *some* things
    (one forex run refreshed 29 series and left 328 stale). **The per-series max date is
    the only honest freshness check.**
11. **A scrape and its ingests are separate assets, so "re-scraped" never implies
    "re-ingested".** Bronze once sat a full day behind a completed scrape — 5 countries
    against 19 on disk — with nothing raising. The check is one query:
    `COUNT(DISTINCT ticker)` in bronze vs the file count in `raw_data/`.
12. **Absent = OFF in `config.json`, and every asset must be listed** — the loader
    **raises** on an unlisted asset, so silence is never how something gets disabled. A
    group gate (`{"enabled": false, …}`) switches off a layer while modules stay visible.
13. **Selection IS the run plan.** `--select` is the whole mechanism; there is no switch
    file left to veto with — see §5a for what was retired and what replaced it.
14. **Disabling an asset does NOT disable downstream** — Dagster keeps the edge and the
    downstream still reads the folder from disk. To stop a chain, disable the downstream.

**Data types & I/O**

15. **`CREATE TABLE AS`, never a pandas round-trip.** psycopg2 returns `numeric` as
    `Decimal` → DataFrame dtype `object` → writer maps `object` to VARCHAR. A read-then-write
    silently turns every price column into TEXT. This trap is documented in three places
    because it has nearly fired in three directions.
16. **`driver.select` used to swallow exceptions and return an empty DataFrame.** It raises
    now, but prefer `UnifiedSchemaReader.read`, which also raises on empty.
17. **SQL `LIKE '_'` is a single-char wildcard** — `'pool__%'` also matches `poolXX`.
18. **Windows/cp1252**: open `metadata.json` and friends with `encoding="utf-8"` (the
    provenance comments carry `⚠️`); PowerShell 5.1's `Out-File -Encoding utf8` writes a
    BOM; and **never put `⚠️` in matplotlib chart text** — Segoe UI has no glyph and it
    renders as a box.
19. **Ephemeral scripts must load `.env` by explicit path** — they live in the scratchpad
    outside the repo, so `find_dotenv()` misses it and `PostgreSQLConnectionDto` raises
    "Password cannot be empty". Use `load_dotenv(os.path.abspath(".env"), override=True)`
    with cwd = repo root.
20. **Line-buffer anything long and write each unit to disk as it finishes.** A 4-hour null
    run was lost entirely to a `TextIOWrapper` that re-buffered on top of `python -u`.

**A finished run is not a run that checked itself** (added 2026-08-14, all three
measured on one `pool__forex` selection — `feature_selection/CONTEXT.md` §17)

21. **A metric that CANNOT FAIL is not a pass — withdraw it.** `hit_rate` is
    `sign(pred) == sign(y)`, and on a price-LEVEL target (`close_adjust_{h}day`) every
    label is positive, so it is **1.0 by construction**. One run reported `+1.0000`
    beside `ic_mean −0.1638`. It is `NaN` → `—` now. The same target makes R² −24.9,
    which is a *measurement* of a bad target and stays.
22. **Coverage is a scalar and a scalar cannot see a FROZEN SOURCE.** A late starter and
    a channel dead since June both score 0.67. Read `trailing_null_sessions` beside it —
    328 of 357 forex channels had carried no value for 40 sessions. This is §5 rule 10's
    per-series max date, one level down, at the feature.
23. **An all-NaN train slice is imputed to the constant `0.0` and then RANKED.** There is
    no median to take, so `_impute` invents one in a unit the channel never had. **197 of
    357 channels in fold 1**, and **44 of the 66 SELECTED**. `validation.csv` carries
    `n_dead_train`/`n_dead_test` per fold now. ⚠️ A rising `ic_trend_per_fold` on a ragged
    pool measures **data arrival**, not a strengthening signal.

### 5a. ⚠️ RETIRED — do not go looking for these, and do not follow old advice about them

Phase 5 (2026-08-05/06) removed the second way to run things. **All four are gone from
disk**, verified 2026-08-10:

| gone | was | replaced by |
|---|---|---|
| `src/main.py` | the run plan — 8 `scraper.scrape()` calls + 3 ingest entry points | `--select` |
| `src/switch_config.json` | 676 flag keys gating every stage | `config.json`'s `parameters` (295 leaves) for what a scrape *enumerates*; `--select` for what *runs*. **A leftover copy now RAISES** |
| `src/data_preprocessor/` | the ETL library | **moved** to `src/orchestration/preprocessor/` — same code, now inside its only caller |
| `src/data_postprocessor/` | 652 lines joining macro + market columns | `gold.economy`, `gold.stock_market`, the unified schema |
| `DataPreprocessor.ingest_{bronze,silver,gold}_data`, `_run_layer` | hard-coded leaf lists that **deliberately did not raise** | one asset per `_ingest_*`, and a failed asset fails the run |

⚠️ **`SwitchHandler` the CLASS still exists and is still used** — but with an explicit
`switches` dict handed in, and **no default path**. Seeing it in the code is not evidence
that a config file drives anything.

⚠️ **Two CONTEXT.md files gave deleted-file instructions until 2026-08-10** — both §5s,
in `web_scraper` and `orchestration/preprocessor`, opened with *"edit
`src/switch_config.json`, then `python src\main.py`"*. Both are now rewritten with the
old text quoted as history. If you find a third, fix it the same way rather than deleting
it: the old mechanism explains the shape of what replaced it.

### 5b. Folders removed 2026-08-10 — ~3.1 GB

| removed | was | recoverable? |
|---|---|---|
| `charts/`, `pdfs/` | 2025-era chart PNGs and report PDFs — outputs of the viz notebooks below | ✅ tracked, `git checkout` |
| `src/visualization/`, `src/visualizer/`, `src/test/` | 4 viz notebooks + their helper + `compare.ipynb`. **Verified dead**: `visualizer` was imported only by those notebooks; they were imported by nothing | ✅ tracked |
| `ocr_env8/`, `ocr_env9/` | the two OCR venvs for experiments 8/9 (1.9 GB) | ❌ rebuild — recipe in each experiment's README. Production parsing is unaffected (`CAFEF_OCR_ENGINE=onnx` in `mt_env`) |
| `raw_data/_archive/` | the pre-2026-08-05 TradingView CSVs (803 MB) | ❌ **re-scrape only** — see `orchestration/CONTEXT.md`. Budget ~2 h for forex |
| `src/logs/`, 38 × `__pycache__` | stale duplicate log dir; bytecode | n/a — regenerable |

⚠️ **`src/utils/constants.py` still defines `{SILVER,GOLD,ARIMA}_VISUALIZATION_LOG_FILE_BASE`.**
Now dead — the notebooks that used them are gone. Harmless, unreferenced, left alone
because this was a folder cleanup and not a code change.

---

### 5c. The `pool__basic` prototype chain — run end to end 2026-08-10

Six stages, network to scored metric, one ticker, one pool. `pool__basic` re-scraped
(`skip_existing=False`, VCB only, 3m24s) and rebuilt to **4,266 rows / 2026-08-07**, from
4,235 / 2026-06-25.

**ELEVEN models, 0 to 4,961 parameters, identical dataset / splits / purge / null:**

| model | params | test IC | test bar | p | R² | RMSE |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `BASELINE_ZERO` | **0** | — (constant) | — | — | −0.001 | **0.03721** ← the floor |
| `BASELINE_AR` | 6 | +0.0557 | +0.0585 ❌ | 0.070 | −0.002 | 0.03723 |
| `BASELINE_RIDGE_STATS` | 25 | +0.1005 | +0.1247 ❌ | 0.095 | −5.19 | 0.09252 |
| `BASELINE_RIDGE_FLAT` | 81 | −0.0397 | +0.0785 ❌ | 0.577 | −3.26 | 0.07677 |
| `MLP` | 257 | **−0.1001** | +0.0908 ❌ | 0.910 | −5.87 | 0.09751 |
| `LSTM` (h=8) | 473 | **+0.0346** | +0.0956 ❌ | 0.249 | −0.111 | 0.03920 |
| `GRU` | 1,105 | −0.0766 | +0.0786 ❌ | 0.726 | −0.031 | 0.03776 |
| **`GBT`** | 1,319 | **+0.1263** | +0.1121 ⚠️ **✅** | **0.035** | −2.11 | 0.06562 |
| `CNN` | 3,745 | −0.0332 | +0.1107 ❌ | 0.657 | −0.008 | 0.03734 |
| `LSTM` (h=32) | 4,961 | −0.0345 | +0.1348 ❌ | 0.726 | −0.059 | 0.03826 |
| *wide, 724 ch — LSTM* | ~276k | −0.0721 | +0.118 ❌ | 0.88 | −0.90 | — |

⚠️ **THE WHOLE SPREAD IS ONE ERROR BAR.** IC ranges −0.100 … +0.126 over 9 scored
models — a span of 0.227 against `SE(IC) = 0.197` at `n_eff = 26.7` (window overlap) and
0.089 at `n_eff = 128` (label overlap). The largest |t| on the board is **+1.42**.
Ranking these architectures is reading noise.

⚠️ **Two runs clear a bar; expectation was 1.1.** `GBT` on `ic` (p = 0.035) and
`BASELINE_AR` on `dir_auc` (p = 0.040), from **11 runs × 2 nulled metrics = 22 tests**.
The null prices in no architecture search (**NUL-1**) and the sweep *is* one.

⚠️ **NOT ONE OF ELEVEN BEATS THE ZERO PREDICTOR ON RMSE**, and the models that rank
best are the ones whose magnitudes are most wrong — `GBT` R² = −2.11, `ridge_stats`
−5.19. Ranking and calibration are separate questions here.

⚠️ **Capacity is real but not the whole story.** The LSTM *flips sign* on capacity alone
(h=32 → −0.0345, h=8 → **+0.0346**), yet the 257-parameter MLP is the worst on the board
on the same design a 25-parameter ridge does best on. `model/CONTEXT.md` §14–§15.

⚠️ **Nothing here changes §2 and everything strengthens it.** Six model families
spanning 0 to 276k parameters all land inside their own nulls.

### 5d. The BANK panel, re-scraped and re-run 2026-08-10

All 20 banks refreshed to 2026-08-07 (`pool__basic` 53,921 → **54,528 rows**), so the
panel has one uniform as-of date. Dataset **27,348 / 12,629 / 13,135 × 20 × 10**, scored
at **panel grain** — `n_eff = n_dates/h` = **131.6**, which is FEWER independent
observations than VCB's 128-per-640-rows, not more.

**Selection: `z = −1.71`, observed −0.0106 BELOW its null's mean of +0.0052.** Decisive
fail, and §13d's reading stands — a sector co-moves, so there is less to rank.

| baseline | params | daily-IC t | evaluator says |
|---|---|---|---|
| `BASELINE_AR` | 6 | **+0.23** | ⚠️ "clears" `ic` at p=0.005, **against a NEGATIVE bar** |
| `BASELINE_RIDGE_STATS` | 61 | **+1.15** | ❌ fails (p=0.254) — the highest t on the panel |
| `BASELINE_RIDGE_FLAT` | 201 | +0.77 | ❌ fails |

⚠️ **NEW ISSUE NUL-3: the evaluator's panel null is not label-neutral.** Its centre moved
with the MODEL (−0.0171 / +0.0076 / +0.0109) and it got both ends wrong — manufacturing a
clear for the weakest model and failing the strongest. **On a panel, quote the daily-IC
t-stat, not `ic_clears`.** `model/CONTEXT.md` §16.

⚠️ **The selection cleared its bar; the model did not clear its own.** `z = +2.15` bought
nothing downstream — which is the two bars working, and the most useful thing the run
measured. `feature_selection/CONTEXT.md` §10d has why `z = +2.15` on 20 draws is weak in
its own right: `p = 0.0476` is the `1/(n+1)` floor, the null is fat-tailed, and this is
the **third** measurement of this pool (§6b `z = +1.56` ❌, §10b `z = +1.46` ❌) under a
third procedure.

⚠️ **The narrow chain is LESS BAD, and it is the STL-1 argument from the other side.**
R² −0.90 → −0.059 on the same ticker, target and splits, at 4,961 parameters instead of
~276k. **Neither shows skill**; "less negative" is not a result.

⚠️ **Re-materialising two pools left 21 siblings on the OLD calendar.** Harmless for a
`pool__basic` build; a rebuild of the 750-channel table would INNER-join back down to
2026-06-25 **and look unchanged**. `status_data` reports it as `pools_behind`.

## 6. State today (2026-08-09/10)

| stage | VCB chain | BANK chain |
|---|---|---|
| selection | ⚠️ **EMPTY — all 22 runs deleted 2026-08-10** (see below) | (shared) |
| `final_features` | `return_5day__final__d20_h5` — 4,235 × 754 (750 ch), `505fbe21a1f0` | `rank_5day__final__d20_h5` — 53,921 × 18 (14 ch), `f5615a68f556` |
| `train_test_creator` | 2,918 / 610 / 635 × 20 × **724** | 26,964 / 12,524 / 13,028 × 20 × 13 |
| `model` | best epoch **7** | best epoch **1** (never beat its init) |
| `result_evaluator` | series grain — **no skill** | panel grain — **no skill** |

| | test IC | test bar | test R² |
|---|---|---|---|
| VCB, series | **−0.0721** | +0.118 ❌ (p 0.88) | **−0.90** |
| BANK, panel | **−0.0209** | +0.0158 ❌ (p 0.84) | −0.018 |

**29/29 runs scored; 6 clearing split-metrics across 5 runs, none of them current, and
`model` §11 already recorded why those are not trustworthy.**

⚠️ **`src/train_test_set/` DOES NOT EXIST ON DISK** (checked 2026-08-10). The table above
is what the chain produced; the tensors are gone. It is gitignored, so this is issue
**RPR-1** rather than a fault — but it means `python -m pipeline` reports
`train_test_creator` as **not ready**, every past run's `dataset_hash` is currently
unverifiable, and the two rows above cannot be reproduced without re-running
`python -m train_test_creator --save` first. ⚠️ **`model/CONTEXT.md` §12 still claims "all
33 pre-2026-08-09 dataset folders are on disk and every config resolves" — that is no
longer true.** 29 run folders DO survive under `src/model/runs/`, and `result_evaluator`
can rescore them from `predictions_*.csv` without any dataset.

⚠️ **The STL-1 rebuild made VCB WORSE, and that is the expected result, not a regression.**
Replacing `max_features=12` with a measured per-run cut took the table 203 → 750 channels
and the dataset 202 → 724 features; test IC went −0.011 → −0.072. Handing an LSTM 724
channels on 2,918 training windows is the whole explanation.

⚠️ **THE REPORT ROOTS WERE MERGED AND THE ARCHIVE DROPPED (2026-08-10).** There is now
**one** folder, `reports/feature_selection/`, holding **no runs** —
`feature_selection_basic`, `_economy` and `_superseded` are gone as paths, and all 22
archived runs with them. Nothing is lost: they were force-added on 2026-08-09, so
`git checkout 884bae0e -- reports/` restores the whole archive. Consequences to hold:

- **`python -m pipeline` now reports `selection` as not ready**, and every stage below it
  has no live shortlist to check against. The study restarts at
  `vcb__basic__return_5day`, then the country sweep.
- ⚠️ **`--scope` is now the ONLY thing keeping two experiments off one table name.** A
  root is a `final_features` GROUP over `(schema, target, setup)` — no term for *which
  pools* — and every entry point seeds at 18, so a `pool__basic` run and a
  `basic+economy_<country>` run in this root are ONE group and get unioned into
  `return_5day__final__d20_h5`. Build with `--scope basic` / `--scope economy_<country>`.
- **The numbers in §2, §5c, §5d and the tables above stand as measurements**; their run
  folders no longer stand as files. Any claim quoting a run path is a history reference.

⚠️ **Not one of those runs cleared anything** — 18 computed no null, 2 failed their own.
Everything downstream inherited that, and the provenance sentence travels verbatim from
the table `COMMENT` into the dataset `metadata.json` into every run's `lineage`.

**Open issues live in [ISSUES.md](ISSUES.md)** (11 open, 30 resolved, codes permanent).
Short version: ⚠️ **`SHP-1`** the forex scraper writes two file shapes and only one was
ever ingested — 71% of the folder was silently discarded until 2026-08-14, and **the
same `value`-only filter sits unchecked on `bonds`/`funds`/`economy`/`indices`**;
`FLT-1` the TradingView forex broker filter fails open for 19 of 47 brokers
(**`WID-1` — the 1,600-column block — was opened and cleared the same day**);
`EVD-1` the missing
nulls are ~1,000 CPU-hours, `NUL-1` the evaluator's null is structurally weak, `DRF-1` 18
channels put 100% of test beyond 5 train-sigmas, `COV-1` 248 of 952 shortlisted rows sit
below 0.95 coverage, `RPR-1` datasets/runs are git-ignored.

| [src/feature_selection/docs/RANKER_COMPARISON.md](src/feature_selection/docs/RANKER_COMPARISON.md) | 4k | asking which ranker to keep, drop or add, or quoting any per-ranker cost. The full scorecard behind `feature_selection` §19 — advantage vs a random-k control, both cost regimes, the ρ=0.864 duplicate pair, the REJECTED mRMR addition, and the two errors the measurement had to correct |

| [src/result_evaluator/CONTEXT.md](src/result_evaluator/CONTEXT.md) | 3k | scoring, the metric set, or panel-vs-series grain. ⚠️ **STALE — it predates `index.py`, the `rebuild_index` schema change and issue NUL-3.** Nothing in it is false; it is silent about all three |

⚠️ **[ISSUES.md](ISSUES.md) (~4k) is the second file to open, not an afterthought.** Ten
open issues. **SHP-1** is the one to read first — a `value`-only filter silently
discarded 71% of the forex folder for as long as that ingest existed, and the same
filter sits unchecked on four sibling ingests. **Four** change how a number may be read:
**NUL-3** (the panel null is not label-neutral — on a panel quote the daily-IC t-stat,
never `ic_clears`), **NUL-1** (no null here prices in selection or architecture search),
**RPR-1** (29 run folders were deleted 2026-08-10 and are unrecoverable), and
**OUT-1** (one corrupt cell — VCB 2026-01-05, `prop_buy_val` 4.001e17 — manufactures a
+0.266 forward correlation, and ~0.1% of `foreign_*` rows carry the same defect: check
the extremes before selecting on any foreign or prop channel). **FLT-1**
bounds what forex data can exist at all: 19 of 47 broker filters fail open, so 37
brokers' books are unreachable.

Other roots: `THESIS_PROGRESS_2026*.md` /
`THESIS_SUMMARY_2026_VI.md` (deliverable write-ups), `feature_groups.md`,
`vn30.csv` / `vn100.csv` (index membership — ⚠️ current, not point-in-time).

**Working preferences** (test.py usage, notebook DataFrame display, the paper-analysis
workflow, log truncation) live in the auto-loaded memory index and are not duplicated here.

## 8. Conventions that hold across the repo

- **`⚠️` marks a claim that cost something to learn.** Do not strip them; add them when you
  measure a new one.
- **Dates on findings, always.** A number without a date cannot be told from a stale one.
- **Record what was measured, not what was concluded** — the tables in these files are
  reproducible checks, which is why they are still trusted months later.
- **Nothing in `feature_selection` writes to the database**; `final_features` is the only
  stage that does. That boundary is enforced by the package split, not a comment.
- **Notebooks named `RUN__*.ipynb` are meant to be run.** Everything else (`study_*`,
  legacy `lstm_*`) is a finished write-up kept for the record.
- **A run folder is immutable.** Re-scoring rewrites metrics from `predictions_*.csv`;
  editing a built dataset's `metadata.json` in place is how a folder stops describing its
  own tensors.
- **git**: `src/model/runs/*/` and `src/train_test_set/` are ignored (only `index.csv` is
  tracked), so a fresh checkout has 27 runs stripped to `results/`. `reports/feature_selection/`
  IS tracked. `raw_data/` is ignored except `raw_data/cafef/financials/`.
